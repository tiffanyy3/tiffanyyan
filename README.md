# portfolio demos

This repository contains demos for HCDE 438 Web Technologies portfolios.

<!-- This is a template repository containing the portfolio page skeleton for my
[Web Technologies](https://github.com/branchwelder/web-technologies) course
(HCDE 438).

The folder structure for this page should look like this:

- `index.html` - your site's home (index) page
- `index.css` - contains the styles for home page
- `bio/` - folder containing the bio page
  - `bio.html` - html for the bio page
  - `bio.css` - styles for the bio page
- `recipe/` - folder containing files for the recipe page
  - `recipe.html` - html for the recipe page
  - `recipe.css` - styles for the recipe page

### Editing your site

Assuming you have installed the VSCode Live Server extension, right click on
`index.html` in the explorer side bar and click "Open with Live Server". The
page should open automatically in your browser. You can now edit the files
containing your site code and your changes will immediately update the browser -
no need to restart the server. -->
